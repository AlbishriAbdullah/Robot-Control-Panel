# Robot-Control-Panel
This repository for first task in the "Web Programming" track.
The main idea of this first task is to design a Robot Control Panel and link it to the database to identify robot directions.
To do this task, I prefer to design the robot control panel using "Java Swing" and link it to the "MySql" database.
